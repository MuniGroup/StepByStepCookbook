StepByStepCookbook
==================
We are going to create a cookbook in a new way. Instead of long descriptions, we want to provide a clear guide from the first step to a finished meal. Full screen photo of a required result and short, clear instructions for each step in a recipe is the base. Recipes will be able to be simply created in smartphones from photos in the gallery or taken by camera. They will be shared through the Internet among users. The users will be able to evaluate them to make the search for good recipes easier.
Of course the app will include searching recipes by categories, name or ingredients.
